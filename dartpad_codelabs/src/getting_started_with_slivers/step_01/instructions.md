# Introduction

Welcome to the introductory sliver workshop for Flutter! ðŸ‘‹

In this workshop, you will learn how to efficiently build
scrolling widgets and use slivers directly to create a rich
scrolling experience for users.

This workshop is best for folks already familiar with building simple
Flutter applications. If this is your first time using Flutter,
check out **[Writing Your First Flutter App](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)**
to get started using Flutter.


## What is a Sliver? 

What is a sliver? A sliver is a portion of scrollable area,
which means anything that scrolls in Flutter is a sliver.
If you've used a `ListView` or `GridView` before, congratulations!
You have already used a sliver somewhere in your Flutter application.
Most often, slivers are wrapped in convenience classes such as these.
This is because slivers use a different layout protocol from most
other widgets in the Flutter framework. We'll discuss this later in
the workshop. For now, let's take a tour of our starter code.

## A Simple Scrolling UI

Here we have a weather forecasting application, called **Horizons**.

This `MaterialApp` consists of a `Scaffold` with a  `WeeklyForecastList`
as the body. This widget consists of a `SingleChildScrollView` that
contains a `Column` featuring the next 7-day forecast.

```dart
SingleChildScrollView(
  child: Column(
    children: <Widget>[
      /* Our 7 day forecast */
    ],
  ),
);
```

We also have our own `ScrollBehavior` set for our application. 

```dart
MaterialApp(
  scrollBehavior: ConstantScrollBehavior(),
  // ...
)
```

`ScrollBehavior`s are inherited by descendent `Scrollable`s. They inform
a `Scrollable`'s `ScrollPhysics` and apply decorations like `Scrollbar`s
and `GlowingOverscrollIndicator`s. 

By default, `ScrollBehavior`s are dynamic and change depending on the
current platform you may be running this workshop on, such as
`ScrollPhysics`. On Mac and iOS platforms, you'll see
`BouncingScrollPhysics` by default, while on others you'll see
`ClampingScrollPhysics`. So we've added a custom
`ScrollBehavior` to provide the same behavior for everyone taking
this workshop.

## Where to next?

Throughout this workshop, we'll build on this code.
We'll convert our `SingleChildScrollView` to be a more efficient,
lazy loading `ListView`. This will allow us to add more to our
application and remain performant.

We'll then dive a little deeper and transform our code to use
slivers directly, and experiment with dynamic scrolling effects
like floating app bars. Move on to the next step to begin!
