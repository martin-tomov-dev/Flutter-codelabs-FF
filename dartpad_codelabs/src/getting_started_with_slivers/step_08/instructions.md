# Completion

Congratulations! You have reached the end of the codelab.

In this codelab we learned to build scroll views efficiently,
using lazy loading for our scrollable.

We converted our scroll view to work with directly with slivers,
and explored the `SliverAppBar` and how it is complimented
by the `FlexibleSpaceBar` widget.

There are a lot more slivers to explore, like `SliverGrid` and
`SliverPadding`. Many are the sliver versions of common box widgets,
instead of `AnimatedList`, try out `SliverAnimatedList`, or
`SliverFadeTransition`, similar to `FadeTransition`

// TODO(Piinks): some kind of pleasant closing? Or no?
