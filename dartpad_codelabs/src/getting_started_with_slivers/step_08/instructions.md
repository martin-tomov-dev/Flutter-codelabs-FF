# Completion

Congratulations! You have reached the end of the workshop.

In this workshop we learned to build scroll views efficiently,
using lazy loading for our scrollable.

We converted our scroll view to work directly with slivers,
and explored the `SliverAppBar` and how it is complimented
by the `FlexibleSpaceBar` widget.

There are a lot more slivers to explore, like `SliverGrid` and
`SliverPadding`. Many are the sliver versions of common box widgets -
instead of `AnimatedList`, try out `SliverAnimatedList`, or
`SliverFadeTransition`, which is similar to `FadeTransition`. All
sliver widgets begin with 'Sliver' in the title.
